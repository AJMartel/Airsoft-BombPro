This was the starting point for the project that has evolved enormously.

Current [Github](https://github.com/AJMartel/FPS_Bomb_Simulator) repo has been moved.

Very little of the original code remains, although I kept the original layout of the actual game play.

The new device is multi-lingual and as of this update has 5 game modes.
